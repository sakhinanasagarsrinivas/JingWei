🌟 Slide 1: AI-Driven Optimization in Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities (Fabs)
Context & Challenges
A semiconductor fabrication facility (fab) manufactures integrated circuits by processing silicon wafers through hundreds of precise, defect-sensitive steps, using expensive, specialized equipment.

Operations are dynamic, with unpredictable equipment failures, urgent orders, and complex interactions between machines and material flow.

Key challenges include:

Scheduling and Dispatching: Long queues of wafer lots, underutilized machines, missed deadlines for high-priority (“hot”) lots due to poor scheduling.

Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS): Traffic congestion, collisions, and hot-lot delays in Overhead Hoist Transport (OHT) systems that move wafer carriers.

Defect Source Detection: Rare, evolving defects go undetected or are misclassified by rule-based inspection systems.

Virtual Metrology: Physical measurements of wafers are slow, expensive, and only cover a small sample.

Predictive Process Control & Maintenance: Reactive control leads to process drift and unplanned equipment failures.

Recipe Optimization: Manual tuning of process parameters is time-consuming and often suboptimal.

Our Objectives
✅ Minimize wafer lot cycle times and work-in-process (WIP) inventory.
✅ Maximize utilization of machines and OHT systems.
✅ Detect and trace novel defect sources accurately at scale.
✅ Predict wafer quality metrics in real time for 100% monitoring.
✅ Dynamically adjust process parameters to maintain yield and stability.
✅ Generate optimal process recipes faster and adapt to product and equipment changes.
✅ Reduce downtime, scrap, and overall operational costs.

AI-Driven Solutions
📌 Scheduling and Dispatching: Use reinforcement learning (RL), machine learning, and optimization algorithms to prioritize high-priority (hot) wafer lots, balance machine utilization, and adapt schedules dynamically to real-time fab conditions.

📌 Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS): Develop intelligent, adaptive control for Overhead Hoist Transport (OHT) systems, enabling dynamic routing, collision avoidance, and prioritization of hot wafer lots while maintaining throughput and safety.

📌 Defect Source Detection: Implement a generative AI (GenAI)-powered image and video analytics platform to detect, trace, and explain rare and evolving defect patterns and operational anomalies in real time.

📌 Virtual Metrology (VM): Use AI and deep learning to predict wafer quality metrics (e.g., film thickness, critical dimensions) directly from process and equipment data, achieving full wafer coverage and rapid feedback.

📌 Predictive Process Control and Maintenance: Deploy machine learning models for real-time optimization of process parameters and early detection of equipment degradation to schedule proactive maintenance.

📌 Recipe Optimization: Apply AI techniques, such as Bayesian optimization and RL, to explore process parameter spaces and automatically generate optimal recipes that balance yield, quality, and throughput.
