 Motivation ‚Äì Why Micrograph Analysis Needs Multimodal AI
High-resolution electron micrographs (from TEM/SEM) capture critical nanoscale structures in semiconductors.

Manual analysis is:
Expertise-intensive and time-consuming, relying on years of domain training.
Non-scalable for high-throughput industrial pipelines.
Vulnerable to intra-class variability (same class appearing structurally different) and inter-class similarity (different classes exhibiting overlapping features).
Impacted by hierarchical structure ambiguity, where fine-, meso-, and macro-scale patterns interfere with clear interpretation.
Susceptible to imaging noise, resolution drift, and artifacts introduced by sample preparation or electron beam interaction.

Scarcity of labeled data inhibits the training of supervised models, especially for rare phases or novel materials.

Standard vision-only models:
Lack scientific contextual grounding, leading to misinterpretation of structurally subtle features.
Struggle with generalization across instruments, imaging conditions, and new domains.
Goal: Develop a scalable, interpretable, and low-resource AI framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment vision pipelines through knowledge injection, reasoning, and semantic grounding.






### üß† Slide 2: LLM-Guided Instruction Synthesis ‚Äì Automating Scientific Supervision

* LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro) are prompted using Zero- and Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to simulate expert-level textual reasoning about electron micrograph features.

* These prompts guide LLMs to generate structured textual descriptions of electron micrographs based on visually observable cues.

* Outputs include:

  * Visually anchored diagnostic questions, e.g.:
    ‚ÄúDoes the image show regular patterns?‚Äù
    ‚ÄúAre there signs of structural boundaries or defects?‚Äù
  * Comparative VQA pairs, e.g.:
    ‚ÄúWhich micrograph looks more regular?‚Äù
    ‚ÄúWhich one has more visible edges or lines?‚Äù
  * Descriptive and hypothesis-driven queries prompting models to reason about noticeable visual differences between micrographs.

* These outputs are used to:

  * Pre-train smaller LMs using masked language modeling (MLM) for nanomaterial-specific adaptation.
  * Generate dense token and text-level embeddings that encode domain-specific interpretive priors.
  * Act as a teacher model, distilling high-level domain knowledge into compact, task-aligned student models through self-supervised and supervised objectives.

Key Benefits:

* Eliminates manual visual labeling by prompting LLMs to express domain-guided hypotheses grounded in visual features.
* Mitigates ambiguity due to intra-class variation, inter-class overlap, and multi-scale texture complexity in electron micrographs.
* Supports deeper representation learning by exposing student models to rich, multi-view supervision (comparative, descriptive, diagnostic).
* Enables scalable, knowledge-distilled learning, allowing student models to inherit reasoning capabilities from powerful foundation models.






### üîó Slide 4: Hierarchical Fusion ‚Äì Learning Rich Representations Across Modalities

Challenge:
Electron micrographs encode multi-scale visual features‚Äîranging from fine-grained textures to mesoscopic structures‚Äîwhich are often non-Euclidean and vary across imaging conditions.

Solution:
Integrate complementary modalities into a unified, learnable representation space:

* Patch-level embeddings (Vision Transformer):
  Extract local contrast, texture, and edge-level details using non-overlapping image patches.

* Graph-based representations:
  Model spatial relationships and inter-region connectivity via graphs or hypergraphs, capturing structural coherence and boundary interactions.

* LLM-derived semantic descriptors:
  Inject material-aware context by embedding outputs from instruction-tuned LLMs that describe synthesis methods, defect patterns, or phase characteristics.

A hierarchical attention fusion mechanism learns to weight and integrate these views across resolution levels and modalities.

Key Benefits:

* Captures both local and global context, aligned with physical and structural priors from materials science.
* Adapts to variability in imaging conditions such as contrast shifts or noise.
* Separates visually similar structures and improves model reliability in unclear or ambiguous regions.
* Enables interpretable multimodal embeddings for downstream tasks like classification, segmentation, and defect detection.
