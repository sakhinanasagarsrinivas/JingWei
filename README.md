🌟 Slide 1: AI-Driven Optimization in Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities (Fabs)
Context & Challenges
A semiconductor fabrication facility (fab) manufactures integrated circuits by processing silicon wafers through hundreds of precise, defect-sensitive steps, using expensive, specialized equipment.

Operations are dynamic, with unpredictable equipment failures, urgent orders, and complex interactions between machines and material flow.

Key challenges include:

Scheduling and Dispatching: Long queues of wafer lots, underutilized machines, missed deadlines for high-priority (“hot”) lots due to poor scheduling.

Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS): Traffic congestion, collisions, and hot-lot delays in Overhead Hoist Transport (OHT) systems that move wafer carriers.

Defect Source Detection: Rare, evolving defects go undetected or are misclassified by rule-based inspection systems.

Virtual Metrology: Physical measurements of wafers are slow, expensive, and only cover a small sample.

Predictive Process Control & Maintenance: Reactive control leads to process drift and unplanned equipment failures.

Recipe Optimization: Manual tuning of process parameters is time-consuming and often suboptimal.

Our Objectives
✅ Minimize wafer lot cycle times and work-in-process (WIP) inventory.
✅ Maximize utilization of machines and OHT systems.
✅ Detect and trace novel defect sources accurately at scale.
✅ Predict wafer quality metrics in real time for 100% monitoring.
✅ Dynamically adjust process parameters to maintain yield and stability.
✅ Generate optimal process recipes faster and adapt to product and equipment changes.
✅ Reduce downtime, scrap, and overall operational costs.
