🌟 Slide 1: AI-Driven Optimization in Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities (Fabs)
Context & Challenges
A semiconductor fabrication facility (fab) manufactures integrated circuits by processing silicon wafers through hundreds of precise, defect-sensitive steps, using expensive, specialized equipment.

Operations are dynamic, with unpredictable equipment failures, urgent orders, and complex interactions between machines and material flow.

Key challenges include:

Scheduling and Dispatching: Long queues of wafer lots, underutilized machines, missed deadlines for high-priority (“hot”) lots due to poor scheduling.

Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS): Traffic congestion, collisions, and hot-lot delays in Overhead Hoist Transport (OHT) systems that move wafer carriers.

Defect Source Detection: Rare, evolving defects go undetected or are misclassified by rule-based inspection systems.

Virtual Metrology: Physical measurements of wafers are slow, expensive, and only cover a small sample.

Predictive Process Control & Maintenance: Reactive control leads to process drift and unplanned equipment failures.

Recipe Optimization: Manual tuning of process parameters is time-consuming and often suboptimal.

Our Objectives
✅ Minimize wafer lot cycle times and work-in-process (WIP) inventory.
✅ Maximize utilization of machines and OHT systems.
✅ Detect and trace novel defect sources accurately at scale.
✅ Predict wafer quality metrics in real time for 100% monitoring.
✅ Dynamically adjust process parameters to maintain yield and stability.
✅ Generate optimal process recipes faster and adapt to product and equipment changes.
✅ Reduce downtime, scrap, and overall operational costs.

🌟 Slide 1: Why Agentic RAG for Time Series?
The Need & Motivation
Time series analysis is foundational in many domains:
📈 Demand forecasting, 📊 anomaly detection in operations, 🧩 missing data imputation in finance & healthcare.

However, time series data is dynamic, non-stationary, and highly context-dependent:

Patterns like seasonality, trends, and regime shifts require context-aware reasoning.

Static, rule-based pipelines cannot adapt to changing data distributions or compose multi-step reasoning.

Why RAG for Time Series?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) brings external knowledge into the reasoning loop, enabling:

Contextual awareness by retrieving similar historical patterns or domain knowledge.

Better handling of rare events, long-range dependencies, and concept drift.

Flexible support for a variety of tasks (forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, imputation) through retrieved guidance.

Why Agentic RAG?
Existing RAG systems are static: fixed retrieval & model application.

Agentic RAG makes RAG dynamic and adaptive, enabling the system to:
✅ Plan what to retrieve and when.
✅ Select the most appropriate time series model based on current task and context.
✅ Iteratively reason and refine outputs, improving accuracy and robustness.

Impact of Agentic RAG
Brings human-like analytical reasoning to time series analysis.

Achieves higher accuracy, adaptability, and compositional generalization compared to traditional pipelines.









🌟 Slide 2: Key Contributions & Strategic Impact
Agentic Framework & Innovations
✅ Hierarchical Agentic RAG Architecture

A master agent interprets user queries and delegates subtasks to specialized sub-agents (forecasting, anomaly detection, imputation, classification).

Sub-agents run small, instruction-tuned language models (SLMs) optimized for their specific time series tasks.

✅ System 2-Style Reasoning Loop

Agent employs deliberate, iterative reasoning (Reason → Act → Reflect), mimicking human analytical decision-making.

Supports re-querying, model chaining, and multi-step workflows.

✅ Differentiable Prompt Pools

Sub-agents maintain prompt pools of encoded temporal patterns and reasoning templates.

Prompts are retrieved based on latent-space similarity and fused with input to encode long-range dependencies and adapt to distribution shifts.

✅ Prompt-Oriented Input Augmentation

Retrieved prompts enrich input windows with relevant historical signals (seasonality, trends, anomalies).

✅ Scalability & Modularity

Plug-and-play architecture: new tasks or models can be added without retraining the master agent.

Independent prompt pool and policy updates enable continual learning and improvement.

Strategic Impact
✨ Adaptive, explainable, and modular time series analysis pipeline.
✨ Improved performance on complex, dynamic time series tasks.
✨ Enables multi-task, compositional workflows and future extensibility.

An intelligent, agentic RAG system that brings human-like reasoning to time series analysis — adaptive, modular, and scalable.
